                <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a
                    hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a
                    legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. Wikipedia</p>

                <p>Alluri Sitarama Raju (4 July 1897 or 1898 – 7 May 1924) was an Indian revolutionary who waged an
                    armed campaign against the British colonial rule in India. Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh, he
                    was involved in opposing the British in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act that effectively
                    restricted the free movement of adivasis in their forest habitats and prevented them from practicing
                    their traditional form of agriculture called 'podu', which threatened their very way of life</p>
